# PanicSQLWPF
This is a mini-project that models a system for tracking student progress. 
# Briefly
There is a table of students and tables of disciplines that contain information about the progress of each student. Primitive authorization is implemented, logins and MD5 of passwords are also stored here. I used Postgresql as my server.
This is my first experience with WPF, SQL, MVVM pattern and asynchrony.
